## What This Repository Includes

### Defect Tracking & Test Management
- Logged and managed software defects using **Mantis Bug Tracker**
- Created detailed defect reports including:
  - Clear summaries and descriptions
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Expected vs actual results
  - Severity, priority, and reproducibility
- Analyzed defect trends and severity distribution
- Provided **release-readiness recommendations** based on defect data

### Risk-Based Testing & Quality Analysis
- Applied **risk assessment techniques** to identify high-impact and high-probability defects
- Evaluated software quality based on **risk exposure, complexity, and failure impact**
- Practiced communicating technical risk findings in a way suitable for management decision-making

### Performance & Load Testing
- Conducted **performance and load testing** using industry-standard testing tools
- Executed tests with varying:
  - Number of users
  - Loop counts
  - Load conditions
- Monitored and analyzed **CPU and memory utilization**
- Interpreted performance graphs to identify bottlenecks and scalability concerns

### Security & Penetration Testing
- Performed **basic penetration testing** in a controlled lab environment
- Used **Kali Linux** for reconnaissance and scanning activities
- Applied tools such as:
  - `fping` for network discovery
  - `nbtscan` for host identification
  - `nmap` for port scanning, OS detection, and service version detection
- Identified open ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities
- Researched known vulnerabilities and provided **security recommendations**

### Test Environment & Tools
- Configured and used test environments with **XAMPP**, virtual machines, and local web applications
- Practiced testing in realistic, industry-style setups
- Executed testing activities as if working in a professional QA role
